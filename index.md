## A Brief Intro...
Our game Uno has the same rules as Uno card game to match either card, number, or color. There are also special cards that change the color of the card it is on, and cards to give extra cards to other players. The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards, and the first player who gets rid of all their cards win!

## Unique Features
While the structure of the whole game is similar to Uno, it also has some special features that makes it unique and interesting. For example, the game is played on a single laptop interface so that players could have face-to-face communications which always keeps up the atmosphere of gameplay. You probably want to ask how could players hide their cards from other people? Well, that's a good question, and the answer is that you never need to get worried because the spaces between each two players are large enough to protect the privacy for both of them. In addition, in our game the card in the middle isn’t an action card, so that the player can match with the first card of the deck. 


## Installation Suggestions
As we mentioned before, only one person in a group of four is required to download the game!
