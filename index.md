## A Brief Intro...
Uno has been one of the most popular card games across the world because it is entertaining, widespread, and easy to play with friends. Our game Uno has the same rules as the Uno card game to match either card, number, or color. There are also special cards that change the color of the card it is on and cards to give extra cards to other players. The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards, and the first player who gets rid of all their cards wins the game!

## Unique Features
While the whole game structure is similar to Uno, it also has some special features that make it unique and exciting. For example, the game is played on a single laptop interface so that players could have face-to-face communications, which always keeps up gameplay. You probably want to ask how players could hide their cards from other people - well, that's a good question, and the answer is that you never need to get worried because the spaces between every two players are large enough to protect the privacy of both of them. In addition, in our game the card, the first card in the middle isnâ€™t an action card, so that the player can match with the first card of the deck. 

## A Quick Look Through the Game
First of all, the four players enter their names, and seven cards from the shuffled deck were drawn to each of them's hands. The game shows the first card of the deck, and the first player is supposed to play a matching card or skip the turn.

In this case, Raul chose the sixth card in his hand to play and pressed _enter_ before Lauren's turn to play.

The second player Lauren chose the _Red Draw Two_ card in her hand.

Therefore, the third player, John, drew two cards from the deck, and the game turned to the last player, and so on.
